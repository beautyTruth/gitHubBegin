# I love gitHub

I love gitHub more than I did before because i have a reason to do so.

## I got my gitHub on like donkey kong.

## Words to live by

Don't be afraid to be yourself. That's all you have.

## Remember for your safety

Don't let someone back in who you have kicked out. That's like giving another bullet to someone who shot you.
